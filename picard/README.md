# The PICARD Front End
The PICARD project is a collaborative effort that involves multiple teams to create a deployable application for experimenting on large data sets. Our team focused on the design of the front-end GUI. The purpose of the GUI is to provide a user-friendly interface for researchers to upload their own datasets, run an experiment, and view the results. We're using React-Vite and Tailwind CSS
